# Stack Game

This project is a browser-based game inspired by Ketchapp's mobile game Stack built using the javascript 3d library - ThreeJS. It offers a similar stacking experience with minimalist visuals and addictive gameplay.
## Features

- Stack Colorful Blocks: Build your stack as high as possible without the blocks falling over.
- Touch or Click Controls: Use your mouse or touch screen to make new blocks fall.
- Increasing Difficulty: The speed increases with each successful block placement, challenging your reflexes.
- Score Tracking: Track your high score and compete with yourself or others.
- Sound effects and background music for a more immersive experience.

## How to Play

- Open the game in your web browser.
- Click or tap the screen to make a new block fall onto the stack.
- Aim for the center of the existing block to maintain a stable stack.
- As you progress, the speed increases, testing your timing and precision.
- The game ends when a block falls off the stack.
